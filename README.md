Delivery 2 AGP - Deferred Rendering

By Students:
- Oriol Capdevila Salinas
- VÃ­ctor Segura Blanco

For this delivery we have a scene with 3 loaded models and several lights, both directional and points.
We have two modes rendering modes implemented, Forward and Deferred, which can be changed in the Init Function of the App.
Deferred Rendering is set by default.
Render to texture is also implemented and we have a secondary screen which shows the Difusse texture, the Depth texture, the Normals texture or the positions texture.

Point Lights are showed with a Sphere Guizmo and Directional Lights are showed with a Quad Guizmo.

We have an FPV camera to move and look around:

- WASD for moving.
- Click + move mouse to look around.
